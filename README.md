# Getting started (Project Description)

This responsive webApp allows the user to add,delete,edit and update employee details.In this project, I have created my own json file and added the data in json format that was given in the document.I wrote function using observables and the 
http functions like get post delete etc. in the employee.service file. I called that service in the employee.ts file. I wrote functions in the ts file that 
would subscribe to the service functions and fetched the observable response. I then interpolated that response in the html file.ngIf Loop condition 
was used to display the entire list of data. 2 way data binding was carried out to fetch the user's entry details in the form as well as to show the already 
existing data in the db.json file.
